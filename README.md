# Deploy Wordpress website with ansible

## Description

This is a school project. I've write **Ansible** script to install _Apache_ server with _PHP_ and _mySql_ database, and another script to install a _Wordpress_ website.

## Installation

1. `git clone https://github.com/remi95/Ansible-Wordpress.git`
2. Rename or duplicate all `.dist` files, remove the `.dist` extension, and set your variables.
3. `ansible-playbook install.yml`
4. `ansible-playbook deploy.yml`
